# CompSys Exam Toolkit (Offline)

This project is an **offline web-based toolkit** designed to support problem solving in the course **Computersystemer** at KU.

The purpose of the app is to provide **deterministic calculation and simulation tools** for typical exam tasks, without relying on internet access or generative AI.  
It is intended for use during a **4-hour exam**, where all aids are allowed except internet and AI tools.

The app focuses on:
- Machine Architecture (cache, pipelines, assembly)
- Operating Systems (virtual memory, TLB, page tables, concurrency)
- Computer Networks ()

All logic is implemented locally in JavaScript and runs fully offline.

## How to run the app

1. Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code**
2. Install the extension **Live Server** (by Ritwick Dey), if not already installed
3. Right-click on `index.html`
